###### About
This project was initially though to be a personal release of MARS to be used by those who wanted a dark interface on MARS among some other basic modifications, however later on I realized more people would like to have it so why not share with everyone.

However as I never learned assembler I wont be capable of modifying any of the underlying systems that make MARS work (at least for now) and I wont be putting excesive effort onto the project as I'm studying and need the time to other tasks.

Appart from that i'm not very into github sharing and publishing as most of my projects are private so if im missing something I would pretty much appreciate constructive criticism.

In case of anything here is my contact *adrianmrv02@gmail.com*
